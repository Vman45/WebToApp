# Web To App

Examples of how to port a Web or HTML5 game to a native Android or Mac App.

## How does it work

The App has a WebView that shows you the content of a embedded HTML file. Simple as that. So it doesn't require Internet to access the Web and online version of your game.

## Things to know (just in case)

* The Mac porting was designed with Xcode 11.
* The Android porting was designed with Android Studio 3.5.

## How to get the .app file (for the Mac version only)

* Open the Mac project in Xcode.

* Click in **Product/Archive**.

* Right click in the first item of the list and then click in **Show in Finder**.

* Right click to (ProductName).xcarchive file.

* Click in **Show package contents**.

* Go to **Products** folder.

* Go to **Applications** folder.

* There is your .app file.
